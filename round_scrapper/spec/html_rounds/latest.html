		<p>Under Express  Entry, candidates who <a href="/english/express-entry/criteria-crs.asp">meet the criteria</a> will be accepted into a pool of  possible candidates for immigration to Canada.</p>
		<p>Candidates will be ranked against others in the pool  using a point-based system called the&nbsp;<a href="/english/express-entry/criteria-crs.asp">Comprehensive Ranking System</a>. Citizenship  and Immigration Canada (<abbr>CIC</abbr>) will regularly select  the highest-ranking candidates from the pool by inviting them to apply to immigrate to Canada as permanent residents.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Entry into the Express Entry pool does not guarantee a candidate will be  issued an Invitation to Apply (<abbr>ITA</abbr>) for permanent residence. Invited candidates  still have to meet eligibility and admissibility requirements under Canada&rsquo;s  immigration law (<em>Immigration and Refugee  Protection Act</em>).</p>
		</div>
		<p>CIC will invite candidates from the Express Entry pool  to apply on a regular basis. Every round of invitations will have a set of <a href="/english/department/mi/index.asp">instructions</a> the electronic system will use to  invite candidates from the pool. These instructions will be posted on this website before each round of invitations.</p>
		<p>These instructions  will include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the date and time of the round of invitations,</li>
			<li>the number  of candidates that will get an ITA, and </li>
			<li>if it  applies, which specific immigration program(s) will be included. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the instructions do not specify which immigration  program the candidates must be eligible for, the invitations will be based  solely on the Comprehensive Ranking System (<abbr>CRS</abbr>) score.</p>
